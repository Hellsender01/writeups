## Challenge Description
Hello! There is a problem with an unknown company data center. Their existing solution is not efficient. Unfortunately, ex-main engineer **Franciszek Warcislaw** left the company. 
All they have is his login to internal company systems: _franciszekwarcislaw_ and codename for solution upgrade operation: _operationsluggishhamster_ . Can you help?

Tools Used :- Sherlock , gpg , Wayback Machine , etc

The Challenge begins with the above description , where the username of Franciszek Warscislaw **(franciszekwarcislaw)** catches the eye....

Initial step was to find any accounts under this username using *Sherlock Osint Tool* ....

![](sherlock.png)

Here, we are able to see that he has a GitHub account in which he has a respository named *_operationsluggishhamster_*
https://github.com/franciszekwarcislaw/operationsluggishhamster

Inside that there was a file named pubkey.gpg which had a public pgp key and a private pgp key...

Now, save the .gpg file and run in terminal as .... gpg pubkey.gpg

![](pubkey.png)

Where we get an Email address of none other than Franciszek Warcislaw i.e franciszek.warcislaw@gmail.com....

Since, he left the company (as the description says) , so I tried mailing him and surprisingly got a REPLY !
It had the much needed pgp message for which the decryption keys are giving in the pubkey.gpg

The message was...
This is my time for vacation! I will be back before 01.01.2021.

Ps. I do not work with hamsters anymore !

So now we got a google docs folder... 

Where the engineer provides his notes on the operation which has 3 photos and the 3rd photo creates suspicion with the line _Maybe we need to think outside the box a little bitâ€¦_

I just checked the frame of the image and noticed a text around the top left corner of the screen in green font....

And this was this FLAG.....atlast RELIEF!!!

# FLAG OBTAINED :---> AFFCTF{GuineaPigsAreTooBigForRunningWheels}

Now there was an other way in this challenge...

While OSINTing the name operationsluggishhamster we got a wordpress page related to it...
https://operationsluggishhamster.wordpress.com/

Now we put the link into wayback machine and got a great green dot on nov 11... 

And the fourth screenshot gave the same image as similar to that of the google doc file with the image with flag in it...
