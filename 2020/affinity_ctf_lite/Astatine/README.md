So this is a Steganography challenge in which we have a **crypted text : 5t4=2<(;4P0Q^YXDIYA21Ltn**

The Challenge title gives us the name... _Astatine_

So.... 
time for a _chemistry class_ for CTF players... ðŸ¤£

_Astatine_ is basically one of the elements in the periodic table having an **atomic number 85**.
It is the rarest naturally occurring element in the Earth's crust.

_End of Class_

This is the hint required "85" and you need to find the type of encryption methods with 85 in their name... 
OR a guy having good cryptographic knowledge can understand that it is **BASE 85 Encryption**

Now you just needed to take the string and submit to **Cyberchef** with base 85 recipie foe decrypting....
and VOILA...



FLAG OBTAINED :-->  AFFCTF{n0t_3nc0d3d}
